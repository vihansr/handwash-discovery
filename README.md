# ðŸ§¼ Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

This notebook steps into the shoes of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician who uncovered one of the most important discoveries in medical history: **handwashing can save lives**. Through data analysis, you will explore the historical medical mystery of high mortality rates in maternity wards and how statistical evidence led to a life-saving protocol.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

In the 1840s, Semmelweis worked at the Vienna General Hospital and observed that many women were dying of childbed fever. This project uses real historical data to analyze:

- Mortality rates in different hospital wards
- The impact of implementing handwashing protocols
- Statistical trends from 1841 to 1849

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The data used in this notebook is based on Semmelweis's original publications from 1861, translated into English for analysis.
